## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that defines how browsers and servers communicate to access resources; resources can be anything from HTML files to data from a database, photos, text, etc. Since an Application Programming Interface (API) is where resources become available, users make requests to these APIs via the HTTP protocol. 
- URL (Uniform Resource Location) is the technical term for what you type in an address bar.  
- DNS (Domain Name System) is the phonebook of the internet. It translates a hostname into a corresponding IP address. 
- A query string is part of the URL that assigns values to certain parameters. 
- Two HTTP verbs are POST and GET. POST is used to create a resource while GET is used to read or retrieve the resource. 
- What is an HTTP request? 
- What is an HTTP response?
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
